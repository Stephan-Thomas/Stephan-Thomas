I don’t write perfect code. I write code that works before the deadline.


⚡ Yo, I’m Stephan
This is my GitHub profile. You’re here because:
- You’re a recruiter stalking my commits.
- You’re a dev trying to “borrow” code.
- You clicked by mistake, and now you can’t leave.

🗡 About Me
- 🧑‍💻 I build web apps, break them, then pretend it was all part of the plan.
- 🐧 Linux is my daily driver (Arch, btw).
- 🎧 My fuel: loud music + late-night debugging.
- 🚀 Current goal: finishing projects before I start 10 new ones.
- ❌ I don’t do “Hello World” tutorials anymore — either ship it or scrap it.
- 👀 I’m a pull-stack developer i.e i pull stuff off people's code and add it to mine

⚙ Tech Arsenal
- Languages: JavaScript (chaotic good), TypeScript (lawful neutral)  
- Frameworks: React, Next.js, Express  
- Databases: MongoDB (YOLO mode), PostgreSQL (actual structure)  
- Other: Git (aka commit archaeology), Docker (pain in containers), Linux (because Windows cried too much)

🔥 Fun Fact
- I don’t chase jobs — I build things that make jobs chase me.

- email me, but if you start with ‘Dear Sir/Madam’, I’m deleting it
